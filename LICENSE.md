# StygianSift License
## A Note from the Creator

Hey there! I built StygianSift because I love making file management both powerful and fun. Before we get into the details, here's the most important thing: if you're an individual user, you're free to explore, modify, and play with StygianSift however you want! Just remember to give a friendly credit back to the project. That's really all I ask.

## Individual Users - Your Freedom to Create!
If you're an individual user, here's what you can do (and yes, it's a lot!):
* ✨ Use StygianSift for absolutely any personal project
* 🔧 Modify the code however you want
* 🎮 Play around and experiment
* 📚 Learn from the code and use it to teach others
* 🔄 Create your own versions
* 🎨 Build cool things with it
* 📦 Include it in your other personal projects

The only thing I ask is:
* 💝 Keep the attribution notice somewhere visible
* 🔗 Link back to the original project when sharing

That's it! No hidden catches, no legal gotchas. Go forth and create amazing things!

## For Educational and Non-Profit Use
You have the same freedoms as individual users! Feel free to:
* 📚 Use it in classrooms
* 🎓 Include it in educational materials
* 🤝 Share it with students and colleagues
* 🔬 Use it in research projects

Just remember the attribution, and maybe let me know how it's helping - I'd love to hear about it!

## For Commercial Users
This is where things get a bit more structured (but still pretty simple):

### Small Businesses (Annual Revenue Under $1M)
* You have the same freedoms as individual users
* Please consider supporting the project if it brings value to your work
* Keep the attribution requirements

### Larger Companies (Annual Revenue $1M+)
* Need a commercial license
* Contact me at [contact info] - I promise we'll keep it simple
* We'll work out fair terms that work for everyone

## What About Contributing Back?
For individual users and small businesses, it's totally optional but always appreciated! You can:
* 🌟 Share your cool modifications
* 🐛 Report bugs you find
* 💡 Suggest new features
* ☕ Buy me a coffee
* 📣 Tell others about StygianSift

## The Legal Bits (Keep it Simple)
While this license emphasizes freedom and trust, it is still a legal agreement. The key points:
* The tool is provided "as is"
* Attribution requirements are legally binding
* Commercial restrictions for large companies are enforced
* Your rights under this license can be revoked if you ignore the attribution requirements or commercial terms
