# StygianSift License

Hey there,

Let me be completely direct about this - I built StygianSift because I don't think things should be boring, seemingly, to be boring less boring,

## What You Can Do (No Legal Strings Attached)
You can:
- Use the code however you want
- Modify it completely
- Share your changes
- Make your own version
- Include it in other projects
- Pretty much anything else you can think of

## All I Ask
Just keep my name and a link back to the original project somewhere visible - that's it. attribution is what is important to me, 

# For Companies
If your company makes over $1M a year, let's chat about licensing (Maui_The_Magnificent@proton.me). For everyone else, go wild - build cool stuff!

## To The Open Source Community
I want to be crystal clear - you are safe to use, modify, and share this code. There won't be any surprise legal actions or licensing changes. I chose this approach because I believe in trust and community over legal threats.

The mythology and playful tone in the code and docs are there to make file management fun, but this license is me being straight with you - make amazing things, share them with others, and just remember where it started.

*The formal bit: StygianSift is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind. Use it responsibly.*
