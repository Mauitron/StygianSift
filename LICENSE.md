# StygianSift License

## A Note from the Creator

I built StygianSift because I believe file management should be both powerful and enjoyable. This license reflects that spirit - it's an agreement built on mutual trust and respect between us, rather than a list of restrictions.

## The Heart of This License

StygianSift is more than just a file manager; it's an invitation to explore, create, and perhaps smile a bit while managing your files. I've chosen this licensing approach because I believe software should bring communities together rather than create barriers. Whether you're an individual user, educator, or business, I want you to feel welcome to use and build upon this work.
