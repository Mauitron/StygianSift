## üìö Embark on a Slightly Unhinged File Management Adventure

Lost in the labyrinth of your project files? Fear not, for Stygian Sift is here to guide you 
through the digital underworld. Inspired by ME, Charon, the mythical ferryman, this tool will 
navigate you through the rivers of data and forests of directories with unparalleled ease. 
Created by a slightly unhinged boatman who spent way too much time ferrying souls and 
muttering about directory structures, this isn't your average file manager. It's a fever 
dream of functionality wrapped in a user interface that actually makes sense.

## üé® Paint Your Files Directories with Colors
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f2de4e9-461e-4ce2-b108-b5538570f65d)

In a stroke of genius (or possibly heatstroke), I devised a color-coding system that's as 
powerful as it is perplexing:

- Red: "Touch not, lest ye awaken the Cerberus!" (Or just corrupt your build, same thing)
- Yellow: "Caution: May contain traces of genius or utter nonsense"
- Blue: "Stable as a three-legged chair, but it'll do"
- Green: "Free to modify, or turn into digital origami, whatever floats your boat"

Plot twist: YOU get to decide what these colors mean. It's like playing god with your file 
system, but less smiting and more organizing! These chromatic enchantments go beyond mere 
decoration - they're a full permission and operation control system:

- Define whether files can be deleted, moved, or renamed per color
- Control whether colored files appear in searches
- Colors cascade up directory trees to protect entire structures
- Set custom rules per color for granular control
- Use filters to view only files of specific colors

## üöÄ Shortcuts That Actually Make Your Life Shorter (in a good way)

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal-based Because Real Programmers Dont Click

Embrace the command line, mortal! Navigate your files with the wild abandon of the 
caffeinated genius that you are! If you need more, summon the terminal within the selected 
directory to perform more complex commands. Return to Stygian Sift when you're done, no 
breadcrumbs needed. Who needs pointing devices when your coding-pinkies could bench more than 
you? Ask yourself, Why point-and-click when you can type-and-curse?

## ‚å®Ô∏è Customizable Keybindings: Bend the Very Interface to Your Will

tools to do your work right at your fingertips? (Terminal based text editors highly 
recommended)

## üõ†Ô∏è Crafted by a Boatman with More Loose Screws Than the Argo

This isn't some tool put together by developers with "experience" or "sanity." It's the 
digital fever dream of a ferryman who decided that bits and bytes were more interesting than 
souls and regrets. Use at your own risk (of increased productivity and possible spontaneous 
iambic pentameter).

## üåü Why Trust Your Files to a Madman's Creation?

- Speed: Because your time is better spent not looking for things.
- Power: Maybe? I don't know what it means, It is written in Rust, does that count?.
- Flexibility: Adapt it to your workflow, not the other way around.
- Fun: Because if you're not laughing while managing files... well, you shouldn't. I am 
  being told that isn't normal, and that people are concerned.

## Common Workflows

## ‚ú® Multi-select Because Why Stop at One

Select files and folders with the enthusiasm of a kid in a candy store. Bulk operations have 
never been more satisfying!

1. Enter select mode with `Ctrl+t`
2. Mark files with `Space`
3. Perform operations (copy, move, delete) on selection
4. Exit select mode with `Esc`

### Power User Tips

- Use color coding to protect important directories
- Set up shortcuts for frequent locations
- Master the search filters for quick file finding
- Utilize git integration for repo management

## Keyboard Shortcut Reference

Here are some of the most commonly used shortcuts:

| Category    | Action           | Default Key |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Navigation | Move up/down     | `k`/`j`     |
|            | Parent directory | `h`         |
|            | Enter directory  | `l`         |
| File Ops   | Copy            | `p`         |
|            | Paste           | `P`         |
|            | Delete          | `D`         |
| Selection  | Toggle select   | `Ctrl+t`    |
|            | Select all      | `Ctrl+a`    |
| View       | Toggle preview  | `Space`     |
|            | Toggle filters  | `Tab`       |

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Permission denied**: Run with sudo or adjust file permissions
- **Preview not working**: Check terminal capabilities and encoding
- **Colors not displaying**: Ensure terminal supports true color
- **Performance issues**: Adjust search depth and preview settings

Remember, in Stygian Sift, I don't just think outside the box. I fold the box into a fancy 
hat and wear it! Why? because it looks snazzy. May your code be buggy in interesting ways, 
and may you always find that one file you swear you put somewhere "logical"!

P.S. No refunds, exchanges, or soul-backsies. Apparently 1 Obol is far below minimum wage. 
All sales are final!

P.P.S Stygian Sift is a work in progress. Visual bugs are to be expected.
