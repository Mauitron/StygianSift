## üìö Embark on a Slightly Unhinged File Management Adventure

Lost in the labyrinth of your project files? Fear not, for StygianSift is here to guide you 
through the digital underworld. Inspired by ME, Charon, the mythical ferryman, this tool will 
navigate you through the rivers of data and forests of directories with unparalleled ease. 
Created by a slightly unhinged boatman who spent way too much time ferrying souls and 
muttering about directory structures, this isn't your average file manager. It's a fever 
dream of functionality wrapped in a user interface that actually makes sense.

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal-based Because Real Programmers Dont Click

Embrace the command line, mortal! Navigate your files with the wild abandon of the 
caffeinated genius that you are! If you need more, summon the terminal within the selected 
directory to perform more complex commands. Return to StygianSift when you're done, no 
breadcrumbs needed. Who needs pointing devices when your coding-pinkies could bench more than 
you? Ask yourself, Why point-and-click when you can type-and-curse?

## üé® Paint Your Files & Directories with Colors
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2f5eb37-db4c-4706-9385-2a1ed3b8253c)

In a stroke of genius (or possibly heatstroke), I devised a color-coding system that's as 
powerful as it is perplexing:

- Red: "Touch not, lest ye awaken Cerberus!" (Or just corrupt your build, same thing)
- Yellow: "Caution: May contain traces of genius or utter nonsense"
- Blue: "Stable as a three-legged chair, but it'll do"
- Green: "Free to modify, or turn into digital origami, whatever floats your boat"
- (Pun very much intended)

Plot twist: YOU get to decide what these colors mean. It's like playing god with your file 
system, but less smiting and more organizing! These chromatic enchantments go beyond mere 
decoration - they're a full permission and operation control system:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41dd9787-f83e-4e97-81c5-9e0bfc7088d0)

- Define whether files can be deleted, moved, or renamed per color
- Control whether colored files appear in searches
- Colors cascade up directory trees to protect entire structures
- Set custom rules per color for granular control
- Use filters to view only files of specific colors

## üöÄ Shortcuts That Actually Make Your Life Shorter (in a good way)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c3375cc-c574-46e2-a74c-041f778bac64)

- Basic shortcuts (0-9) for your most-used directories
- Shift + numbers for setting new shortcuts
- Control + numbers for accessing shortcut layers (Coming soon!)
- Each shortcut remembers your position in that directory
- Name your shortcuts for better organization
- Quick-jump between related directories

## ‚å®Ô∏è Customizable Keybindings: Bend the Very Interface to Your Will
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03fbe400-5a89-4a6c-9fd4-087230c396e4)

Make the interface dance to your tune. Remap keys until your muscle memory sings with joy.

## üîç Fuzzy Search: Summon Files with But a Whisper of Their True Name
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d33e391f-7799-4f42-bdcb-20fd9d7321c1)

I mean, you can look for what ever you want... I understand your hands might be busy, The 
Stygian Fuzzy Search‚Ñ¢ understands your intentions, even if your fingers don't.

## üå≥ Navigational Tree Sorcery

Who says trees only grow one way? With StygianSift, your file tree is a
shape-shifting marvel:

- Sort by name, size, date, or the phase of the moon (okay, maybe not that last
  one)
- Alphabetical today, chronological tomorrow, size-based when you're feeling
  judgmental
- Watch your directories dance in excitement as they do your bidding!

## ü§§ A Visually Seductive Interface... Which is Not a Wierd Thing to Say!
- Entries fade based on distance from your selection
- Customizable dimming intensity and distance (in code only at the moment)
- Color and brightness preservation for important items
- Visual breadcrumbs through directory structures
- Instant feedback on current location

## üìù BYOE (Bring Your Own Editor)

Tired of fighting with vs code? Nostalgic for your trusty notepad? Fear not! StygianSift 
lets you summon your preferred text editor to put quill to parchment! Why wouldn't you want 
tools to do your work right at your fingertips? (Terminal based text editors highly 
recommended)

- Set your editor of choice (I won't judge... much)
- Open files with a keystroke, because who has time for double-clicking?
- As always, Return to the Stygian realm when you're done, because yes.

## üï≥Ô∏è The Undo System: Your Safety Net in the Void

StygianSift implements a sophisticated undo system that would make time travelers jealous:

- RAM-based undo for quick operations
- Disk storage for larger operations 
- Configurable storage limits for both RAM and disk
- Preserves file metadata and permissions
- Handles multiple file operations
- 
## ‚ú® Multi-select Because Why Stop at One
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46360bd7-e027-4743-b783-3792ad5b9ff2)
You want to impress that girl over there? Show here how massive your file operations are!
Why settle for manipulating just one file when you can wrangle a whole herd? The multi-select
feature makes file operations a whole lot more convenient:

1. Enter select mode with `Ctrl+t`
2. Mark files with by holding `Shift` and normal navigation
3. Perform operations (copy, move, delete etc) on selection
4. Exit select mode with `Esc`

You can also just hold shift and move... but that just standard stuff.

## üëÅÔ∏è Preview Pane: Your Window into the Souls of Your Files
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef755418-c5ab-4d40-9b34-aa17b71eb46c)

The preview pane is more than just a pretty face:

- Handles massive files without breaking a sweat
- Smart file type detection
- Text for you coding files
- Hex view for binary files
- Directory tree previews
- Metadata display
- Customizable preview size

## üìä Metadata Mania

Dive deeper into your files' naughty secret little lives:

- Creation dates: because it's important to remember birthdays
- File sizes: Because they are always heavier than they look
- Permissions that read like ancient hieroglyphs (but useful ones!)
- Git status integration
- Extended attributes
- Owner and group information
- Inode details
- Hard link count
  
## üíæ The Config File: Your Digital Diary

Your preferences, remembered:

- Saves your settings 'lest you forget!
- Carries your choices across sessions like a loyal butler
- Configurable right in the TUI!

## üõ†Ô∏è Crafted by a Boatman with More Loose Screws Than the Argo

This isn't some tool put together by developers with "experience" or "sanity." It's the 
digital fever dream of a ferryman who decided that bits and bytes were more interesting than 
souls and regrets. Use at your own risk (of increased productivity and possible spontaneous 
iambic pentameter).

## üåü Why Trust Your Files to a Madman's Creation?

- Speed: Because your time is better spent not looking for things.
- Power: Maybe? I don't know what it means, It is written in Rust, does that count?.
- Flexibility: Adapt it to your workflow, not the other way around.
- Fun: Because if you're not laughing while managing files... well, you shouldn't. I am 
  being told that isn't normal, and that people are concerned.

## Keyboard Bindings Reference

Here are some common Bindings to get you started:

| Category    | Action           | Default Key |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Navigation | Move up/down     | `k`/`j`     |
