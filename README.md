## üìö Embark on a Slightly Unhinged File Management Adventure

Lost in the labyrinth of your project files? Fear not, for Stygian Sift is here to guide you through the digital underworld. Inspired by ME, Charon, the mythical ferryman, this tool will navigate you through the rivers of data and forests of directories with unparalleled ease. Created by a slightly unhinged boatman who spent way too much time ferrying souls and muttering about directory structures, this isn't your average file manager. It's a fever dream of functionality wrapped in a user interface that actually makes sense.

## üé® Paint Your Files Directories with Colors!

In a stroke of genius (or possibly heatstroke), I devised a color-coding system that's as powerful as it is perplexing:

- Red: "Touch not, lest ye awaken the Cerberus!" (Or just corrupt your build, same thing)
- Yellow: "Caution: May contain traces of genius or utter nonsense"
- Blue: "Stable as a three-legged chair, but it'll do"
- Green: "Free to modify, or turn into digital origami, whatever floats your boat"

Plot twist: YOU get to decide what these colors mean. It's like playing god with your file system, but less smiting and more organizing! These chromatic enchantments go beyond mere decoration - they're a full permission and operation control system:

- Define whether files can be deleted, moved, or renamed per color
- Control whether colored files appear in searches
- Colors cascade up directory trees to protect entire structures
- Set custom rules per color for granular control
- Use filters to view only files of specific colors

## üöÄ Shortcuts That Actually Make Your Life Shorter (in a good way)

Shortcuts in Stygian Sift work in layers, like a well-organized chaos:

- Basic shortcuts (0-9) for your most-used directories
- Shift + numbers for setting new shortcuts
- Control + numbers for accessing shortcut layers (Coming soon!)
- Each shortcut remembers your position in that directory
- Name your shortcuts for better organization
- Quick-jump between related directories

## üñ•Ô∏è Terminal-Based, Because Real Programmers Don't Click

Embrace the command line, mortal! Navigate your files with the wild abandon of the caffeinated genius that you are! If you need more, summon the terminal within the selected directory to perform more complex commands. Return to Stygian Sift when you're done, no breadcrumbs needed. Who needs pointing devices when your coding-pinkies could bench more than you? Ask yourself, Why point-and-click when you can type-and-curse?

### ‚å®Ô∏è Customizable Keybindings: Bend the Very Interface to Your Will [‚Üë](#stygian-sift-navigate-the-digital-styx-with-a-touch-of-madness)
Make the interface dance to your tune. Remap keys until your muscle memory sings with joy.

### üîç Fuzzy Search: Summon Files with But a Whisper of Their True Name [‚Üë](#stygian-sift-navigate-the-digital-styx-with-a-touch-of-madness)
I mean, you can look for what ever you want... I understand your hands might be
busy, The stygian fuzzy search understands your intentions, even if your
fingers don't.

## üåü Why Trust Your Files to a Madman's Creation?

- Speed: Because your time is better spent not looking for things.
- Power: Maybe? I don't know what it means, It is written in Rust, does that count?.
- Flexibility: Adapt it to your workflow, not the other way around.
- Fun: Because if you're not laughing while managing files... well, you shouldn't. I am being told that isn't normal, and that people are concerned.

### üå≥ Navigational Tree Sorcery [‚Üë](#stygian-sift-navigate-the-digital-styx-with-a-touch-of-madness)
Navigate through your directories with the grace of a digital dryad.
Sort, filter, and traverse your file system, and look cool doing it!

- Entries fade based on distance from your selection
- Customizable dimming intensity and distance
- Color and brightness preservation for important items

## üìù BYOE (Bring Your Own Editor)

Tired of fighting with vs code? Nostalgic for your trusty notepad? Fear not! Stygian Sift lets you summon your preferred text editor to put quill to parchment! Why wouldn't you want tools to do your work right at your fingertips?
(Terminal based text editors highly recommended)

- Set your editor of choice (I won't judge... much)
- Open files with a keystroke, because who has time for double-clicking?
- As always, Return to Stygian's realm when you're done, because yes.

## üìä Metadata Mania

### üõ†Ô∏è Crafted by a Boatman with More Loose Screws Than the Argo [‚Üë](#stygian-sift-navigate-the-digital-styx-with-a-touch-of-madness)

## Common Workflows

### ‚ú® Multi-select Because Why Stop at One [‚Üë](#stygian-sift-navigate-the-digital-styx-with-a-touch-of-madness)

4. Exit select mode with `Esc`

### Power User Tips
